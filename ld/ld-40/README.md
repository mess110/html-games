SmackEm
-------

The front porch owned by Critter Control has been infested though a
coordinated attack by the Mole Hole Gang and things are out
of control.

The Critter Control people look in the address book and search
for Critter Control.. They call but the line is busy. They panic
but wait: Hammer Time!

A hammer is behind the glass.

Scene switches to the garden, there are fences which limit the area.
The moles are underground and you can only see rubble

When a mole pops up, you need to hit it on the head. They will
taunt you in different ways.
